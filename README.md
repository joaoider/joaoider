# Hello everyone!

I'm João, **data scientist** and **physicist**. I'm currently a Data Scientist at Diamond Log, working with Advanced Analytics, and PhD candidate, working with semiconductor physics and software and hardware development.

In my work, and to contribute to my research in semiconductor physics, I develop solutions based on Artificial Intelligence using tools like *Python*, *R*, *SQL*, *GCP* and *Power BI*. Other things that help my work are my hobbies: reading, sports and saxophone.

If you wanna know more about me and my work you can look here and the other links below. Thanks.
