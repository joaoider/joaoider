# Hello everyone!

I'm João, **Data Scientist** and **Physicist**. I'm currently a Data Scientist at Restoque S/A and Diamond Log, working with Advanced Analytics, and PhD candidate, working with Solar Energy, PV cells, Semiconductor Physics and software and hardware development.

In my work, and to contribute to my research in Solar Energy, I develop solutions based on Operational Research and Artificial Intelligence using tools like *Python*, *R*, *SQL*, *GCP*, *Azure*, *AWS* and *Power BI*. Other things that help my work are my hobbies: reading, sports and saxophone.

If you wanna know more about me and my work you can look here on LinkedIn and the other links below. Thanks.
